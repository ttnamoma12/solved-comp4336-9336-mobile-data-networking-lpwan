Q1.




PHY A uses a guard interval (GI) of 400 ns to combat inter-symbol intereference. PHY B is derived by down clocking PHY A by a factor of 5. What is the length of GI used by PHY B?




Q2.




What is the maximum number of non-overlapping channels possible in an 82.11ah network deployed in the U.S.A?




Q3.




A startup company decides to provide water quality monitoring service for all the swimming pools in a neighborhood using the emerging 802.11ah technology. It plans to deploy floating pH sensors in the pools, which will send periodic pH data, measured once every hour, to a central server. The pH sensors will use 802.11ah to upload the data to a nearby AP, but they can be configured to send each sample immediately after their measurement, or locally buffer few samples and send all buffered data together to reduce MAC overhead. It takes 10 bytes to read and store each sample.  If the startup company wants to keep the 802.11ah MAC overhead within 10%, how frequently the pH sensors should upload the data?




Q4.




What is the difference in sweeping times between a 100 kHz channel and 1 MHz channel when they employ 1 MHz/s linear chirps?




Q5.




Binary linear chirp modulation is used to transmit data over a 2 MHz channel. What data rate can be achieved with 1 THz/s chirp rate?
